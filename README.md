# Tableau Exploration - WBNA

With the data given, the goal was to use Tableau to draw insights on the Phoenix Mercury WNBA team for a suite-level audience. 

The attached files have the workbooks in tableau as well as the presentation given. 

#### Overview

After winning the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) Championships in 2014, the Phoenix Mercury’s playoff showing has been inconsistent in the past decade. This ultimately resulted in the team failing to make the 2023 playoffs. We have explored specific defensive and offensive statistics as well as looked into management changes and the locker room environment. Based on this exploration, we are prepared to make recommendations to the Phoenix Mercury leadership on how to get back to the top. 

Our audience, comprising the new head coach, Nate Tibbetts, and the new general manager, Nick U'Ren, is crucial in effecting the necessary changes leading up to the 2024 season. Because Tibbetts lacks direct women’s basketball experience, his position as the highest-paid coach in the league has caused controversy. U'Ren, with a background in basketball operations for the successful Golden State Warriors, brings valuable executive experience.  Using their collective knowledge and experience, we are confident that the proposed changes will position the team for success and restore its competitive edge in the WNBA.

The main ideas we are going to address include the recent poor performance of the team, marked by inconsistency in the roster, coaching, and management. The presence of big egos and players in the news has further exacerbated the team's challenges, with defensive and offensive performance reflecting these issues. Our recommendations center on the need for strategic changes to the roster, emphasizing the addition of new players or enhancing cohesion among existing ones, with the ultimate goal of improving overall team performance.
